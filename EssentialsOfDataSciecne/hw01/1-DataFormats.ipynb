    "#### - What is the description of the data?\n",
    "The description of this data is a bit different because there are multiple data sets on this given website. However, the data in general is for the National Centers for Enviornmental Information. There are many different data sets you can selsect to view like U.S. Local Climatological Data, Climate Maps of the United States and more.\n",
    "#### - What is the data for?\n",
    "The data is for different climate and weather for the United States.\n",
    "#### - How was the data collected?\n",
    "Each of the data sets were gathered using different units of measure, methods and other facotrs. For example \"5.Storm Data Publication/Database\" was collected using the National Climatic Data Center and the National Severe Storms Forcast Center.\n",
    "#### - What format is the data in?\n",
    "Like said above, there are mutiple data sets on this website. They are mostly in PDF format as more reports but some do have options for CSV or excel data sheets.\n",
    "#### - Is the data up-to-date/recent?\n",
    "Majority of the data I observed looked to be up to date or at least updating soon.\n",
    "#### - What kinds of examples are there of the data?\n",
    "Local Climatological Data, Weather Maps/Charts, Climatic Wind Data Publication and more data sets centered around data.\n",
    "#### - Is the data easily accessible?\n",
    "Yes, the data is failry accessible? to at least sample and look at.\n",
    "#### - What restrictions are there on using the data?\n",
    "You have to pay for the full data set on majority of the sets availible from this website.\n",
    "#### - Can you think of something you could learn from analyzing this data?\n",
    "I could probably learn more about weather charting and potentially predict weather movement for different regions of the U.S.\n",
    "#### - Can you think of some issues or challenges (e.g., is the data too old? Is data missing?) you might have if you analyzed this data?\n",
    "One of the largest issues is having to pay for it but other than that the data seemes to be up to date. It also would be difficult to analyze it if it didn't come in some for of CSV or other type of data table set. "

    "It varies but overall not very up to date research I saw from the abstracts I looked at. The earliest year I saw was 2010.\n",

    "Samples, class, time, Gene Names, graphs/plots of data, descritions, etc...\n",
    "#### - Is the data easily accessible?\n",

    "I could probably understand the groth rate of cancer cells and other ways in which healthy cells interact with cancer cells.\n",
    "#### - Can you think of some issues or challenges (e.g., is the data too old? Is data missing?) you might have if you analyzed this data?\n",
    "For me the biggest challenge would be trying to figure out what the data was talking about in terms of medical vocabulary. Then,, understanding what the outcomes of their data actually means."
